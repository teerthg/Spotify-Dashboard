# Spotify Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive **Spotify Dashboard** using **Power BI**. The dashboard visualizes Spotify data, providing insights into streaming trends, track characteristics, artist performance, and other key metrics related to Spotify's streaming data. The visualizations are designed to help users quickly analyze Spotify data across different tracks, artists, and time periods.

## Features:
- **Total Streams**: Displays the total number of streams for all tracks in the dataset.
- **Danceability, Energy, Valence**: Gauges for different track characteristics that show the danceability, energy, and mood of tracks.
- **Track Characteristics Comparison**: A scatter plot visualizing track features like danceability, energy, and valence across different tracks.
- **Top Tracks by Streams**: A bar chart showing the most streamed tracks on Spotify.
- **Track Streams Over Time**: A line chart displaying streaming trends over the years.
- **Speechiness & Acoustics Distribution**: A scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between speechiness and acousticness of tracks.
- **Popular Artists by Track Count**: A bar chart showing the most popular artists by the number of tracks in the dataset.
- **Tracks by Key**: A bar chart showing the distribution of tracks across different musical keys.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this dashboard contains Spotify data for various tracks, including:
- **Track Name**: The name of the track.
- **Artist**: The artist associated with the track.
- **Streams**: The number of streams for each track.
- **Danceability**: A measure of how suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Energy**: A measure of the energy level of the track.
- **Valence**: A measure of the musical positiveness of the track.
- **Speechiness**: A measure of how much the track contains spoken words.
- **Acousticness**: A measure of the acoustic quality of the track.
- **Release Year**: The year the track was released.
- **Key**: The musical key of the track.

## Power BI Visualizations:
- **Gauge Charts**: Used for visualizing danceability, energy, and valence.
- **Bar Charts**: Used for top tracks by streams and popular artists by track count.
- **Scatter Plots**: Used for track characteristics comparison and speechiness & acoustics distribution.
- **Line Chart**: Used to visualize track streams over time.
- **Map (if applicable)**: Geo-location-based visualizations could be added if location data is available.
